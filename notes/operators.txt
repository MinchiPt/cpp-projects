# Operator - (a > b) ? a : b

The expression `(a > b) ? a : b` in the code is an example of the conditional operator, which is also known as the ternary operator. This operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement and is the only operator in C++ that takes three operands:

- The first operand `(a > b)` is a condition that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- The second operand `a` is the value that will be returned if the condition is `true`.
- The third operand `b` is the value that will be returned if the condition is `false`.

So, the expression `(a > b) ? a : b` can be read as "if `a` is greater than `b`, then return `a`, otherwise return `b`." This is a concise way to return the maximum of the two values `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater, `a` is returned; if not, `b` is returned.

Here's the equivalent code using an if-else statement to make this clearer:

```cpp
int max(int a, int b) {
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
}

```

The ternary operator is often used to make the code more compact, especially in simple conditional assignments or returns.
